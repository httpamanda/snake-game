# Snake Game
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Snake Game project. I built this game from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a fun way to showcase my coding skills. Here's a quick rundown of what makes my Snake Game special:

- **Personal Touch:** Every line of code reflects my style and approach to problem-solving.
- **Responsive Design:** Playable on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- **Clean Code:** Easy to understand and maintain, with comments where necessary.
- **Passion for Learning:** I embraced challenges and sought out solutions to improve my skills.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use `git clone` to grab the project files.
2. **Open `index.html`:** Launch the game by opening `index.html` in your browser.
3. **Controls:** Use arrow keys to control the snake and munch on food.
